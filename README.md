# 2022_S1_CS373_AssignmentSkeleton

This repository provides a Python 3 code skeleton for the image processing assignment of CompSci 373 in Semester 1, 2022.

This assignment will require you to use what we have studied in the image processing lectures to generate a software that detects license plates in images of cars - a technology that is used routinely for example on toll roads for automatic toll pricing.

You will receive 10 marks for solving the license plate detection problem, and there will be an additional component for 5 marks, where you will extend upon the license plate detection, and write a short reflective report about your extension.
